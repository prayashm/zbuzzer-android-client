    <string name="about_desc">This app came into being as we needed a jugaad for professional buzzers at our quizzing sessions. Though we had traditional electrical buzzers, they would cost us money.\nI wanted to use smartphones for this purpose as everybody has them. The source code of this application is available at github.</string>
